write a golang code for printing hello world

To print "Hello, World!" in Go, you can use the following code:

Go

    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
    }

**Explanation:**

*   **`package main`**: This line declares the package as `main`. In Go, executable programs must belong to the `main` package.
*   **`import "fmt"`**: This line imports the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatted I/O (input/output), including printing to the console.
*   **`func main()`**: This is the main function where the program execution begins. Every executable Go program must have a `main` function.
*   **`fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`**: This line calls the `Println` function from the `fmt` package. `Println` prints the given string to the console, followed by a newline character.

**How to run this code:**

1.  **Save:** Save the code in a file named `hello.go` (or any other name ending with `.go`).
2.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3.  **Run:** Execute the command `go run hello.go`.

This will compile and run the program, and you will see "Hello, World!" printed on your console.

change it to Good Evening world

To change the output to "Good Evening, World!", you simply need to modify the string inside the `fmt.Println()` function.

Here's the updated Go code:

Go

    package main
    
    import "fmt"
    
    func main() {
    	fmt.Println("Good Evening, World!")
    }

**Explanation:**

The only change is within `fmt.Println()`, where `"Hello, World!"` has been replaced with `"Good Evening, World!"`. When you run this code, it will now print "Good Evening, World!" to your console.
