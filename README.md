# MD File Creator Chrome Extension

## Use Case
This Chrome extension simplifies the process of saving `.md` (Markdown) files directly from the Gemini platform. It is designed to automate the task of copying content and saving it as a Markdown file, which is especially useful for developers and content creators who frequently work with Gemini and Markdown files.

## Problem Statement
Previously, saving `.md` files from Gemini required a manual process:
1. Copying the content from the Gemini platform.
2. Opening a text editor.
3. Pasting the content.
4. Saving the file with a `.md` extension.

This repetitive process was time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with multiple files. The need for automation led to the creation of this extension.

## Solution
The MD File Creator extension automates the entire process:
1. It identifies the relevant content (e.g., `<h2>` tags) on the Gemini platform.
2. It allows users to customize the filename via a popup.
3. It saves the content as a `.md` file with a single click.

## Tools Used
- **Gemini**: The platform from which content is extracted.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Used to assist in the development of this extension, providing code suggestions and solutions to streamline the process.

## How to Use
1. Install the extension in Chrome.
2. Navigate to the Gemini platform.
3. Click the "Start Extension" button.
4. Customize the filename in the popup (if needed) and click "Save."
5. The `.md` file will be downloaded automatically with the clipboard content.
